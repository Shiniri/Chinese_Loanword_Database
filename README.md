# Chinese_Loanword_Database

This database contains loanwords in various Chinese varieties from other languages.

## Introduction

Probably due to the restrictive phonotactic structure of Chinese its varieties contain
relatively few loanwords from other languages. Additionally, loanwords are sometimes
very hard to identify because they are highly integrated into the Chinese morpho-phonemic
system. Thus, I have made this database to aid the research of Chinese loanwords (and out of
personal interest). Currently, it contains all loanwords that I have come across myself
in various Chinese varities and their:
  - Hanzi representation
  - Pinyin Representation
  - IPA (optional)
  - Original form in donor language
  - English translation
  - Additional information, e.g. about the donor language

## How to use

TO_DO: put in functions from database_tools

## Suggest additions

On the off chance that someone takes interest in this project (you, for example!):
my contact email address is mariebauer2610@gmail.com. There you can suggest loanwords
you came accross, ideally with a quotation if you took them from an available corpus
and the meta-information also included in my database. Alternatively, you can just
make a request to edit the repository itself. Same goes for changes to already existing
words.
