# Chinese_Loanword_Database

This database contains loanwords in various Chinese varieties from other languages.

## Introduction

Probably due to the restrictive phonotactic structure of Chinese its varieties contain
relatively few loanwords from other languages. Additionally, loanwords are sometimes
very hard to identify because they are highly integrated into the Chinese morpho-phonemic
system. Thus, I have made this database to aid the research of Chinese loanwords (and out of
personal interest). Currently, it contains all loanwords that I have come across myself,
together with information about what language they come from, the varities in which they
appear, their Hanzi- and Pinyin-representation aswell as translations into English.

## How to use

You can either make queries over the GUI in this repository, or just download the
chinese_loanword_database.db from this repository and make your own SQlite queries.
For now, the database contains the 

TO_DO: add information about GUI and the db-tools

## Suggest additions

On the off chance that someone takes interest in this project (you, for example!):
my contact email address is mariebauer2610@gmail.com. There you can suggest loanwords
you came accross, ideally with a quotation if you took them from an available corpus
and the meta-information also included in my database. Alternatively, you can just
make a request to edit the repository itself.
